Proposed New Wording
====================

Futures
-------

1.  A <dfn>future</dfn> is an object that represents a value that may not available yet.

2.  A [=future=] consists of two components: content and status.

3.  A <dfn data-lt="future's content|future content">future's content</dfn> is either a value or error.

4.  A <dfn data-lt="future's status|future status">future's status</dfn> is either [=not ready=], [=ready=] or [=consumed=].

5.  A <dfn data-lt="not ready|not ready future">not ready future</dfn> is a future whose content is not available yet.

6.  A not ready future may be <dfn data-lt="made ready|make ready">made ready</dfn>, an operation that atomically sets the [=future's content=] and changes [=future's status|its status=] to [=ready=].

7.  A <dfn data-lt="ready|ready future">ready future</dfn> is a future whose content is available.

8.  A [=ready future=] may be <dfn data-lt="made consumed|make consumed">made consumed</dfn>, an operation that atomically invalidates the [=future's content=] and changes [=future's status|its status=] to [=consumed=].

9.  A <dfn data-lt="consumed|consumed future">consumed future</dfn> is a future whose [=future content|content=] was available previously and is now unavailable.

10. A program has undefined behavior if it accesses the [=future content|content=] of a [=not ready=] or [=consumed future=].

`FutureContinuation` Requirements
----------------------------

<!-- Based on [container.requirements], [utility.arg.requirements], [thread.req.lockable], and [allocator.requirements] -->

1.  A <dfn>future continuation</dfn> is a <a href="eel.is/c++draft/func.def">callable object</a> associated with a future.

2.  A `FutureContinuation` type shall meet the requirements described in the Tables below.

-------------------------

<!-- Based on [container.requirements], [utility.arg.requirements], [thread.req.lockable], and [allocator.requirements] -->

    operations implemented in the continuation.

    **Effects:**
      When `rcf` becomes nonexceptionally ready, and if `NORMAL` is a
      well-formed expression, creates an execution agent which invokes `NORMAL`
      at most once, with the call to `DECAY_COPY` being evaluated in the thread
      that called `then_execute`.

      Otherwise, when `rcf` becomes exceptionally ready, if `EXCEPTIONAL` is a
      well-formed expression, creates an execution agent which invokes
      `EXCEPTIONAL` at most once, with the call to `DECAY_COPY` being evaluated
      in the thread that called `then_execute`.

      If `NORMAL` and `EXCEPTIONAL` are both well-formed expressions,
      `decltype(EXCEPTIONAL)` shall be convertible to `R`.

      If `NORMAL` is not a well-formed expression and `EXCEPTIONAL` is a
      well-formed expression, `decltype(EXCEPTIONAL)` shall be convertible to
      `decltype(val)`.

      If neither `NORMAL` nor `EXCEPTIONAL` are well-formed expressions, the
      invocation of `then_execute` shall be ill-formed.

      May block pending completion of `NORMAL` or `EXCEPTIONAL`.

      The invocation of `then_execute` synchronizes with
      (C++Std [intro.multithread]) the invocation of `f`.

      Stores the result of either the `NORMAL` or `EXCEPTIONAL` expression, or
      any exception thrown by either, in the associated shared state of the
      resulting `ContinuableFuture`. Otherwise, stores either `val` or `e` in
      the associated shared state of the resulting `ContinuableFuture`.

    **Synchronization:** The destruction of the continuation that generates
      `rcf`'s value synchronizes-with the start of `g` and with the destruction
      of `g`.

`SharedFuture` Requirements
--------------------------------

<!-- Based on [container.requirements], [utility.arg.requirements], [thread.req.lockable], and [allocator.requirements] -->

1. A <dfn>shared future</dfn> is a [=future=] that is copyable, is bound to an executor and that allows one or more continuation to be attached to it.

2. A `SharedFuture` shall meet the `ContinuableFuture` requirements, the `CopyConstructible` requirements, the `CopyAssignable` requirements and the requirements described in the Tables below.

`std::standard_promise`
-----------------------

```
template<class T>
class standard_promise {
public:
    using promise_default_executor = implementation-defined;

    standard_future<T, promise_default_executor> get_future();
    standard_semi_future<T> get_semi_future();
};
```

The default executor type for promises allows for efficient promise->future
code. This executor is intended for use only locally. It may be optimised
using thread-local storage and should not be constructible. It is not copyable
and its lifetime is not guaranteed to outlive a single continuation chain
starting with a promise.

`std::standard_semi_future`
---------------------------

```

    bool valid() const

};
```

```
bool standard_continuable_future<T, E>::valid() const noexcept;
```

*Returns:* Returns true if this is a valid future. False otherwise.

```
standard_shared_future<T, E> standard_continuable_future<T, E>::share() &&;
```

*Returns:* standard_shared_future<R>(std::move(\*this)).

*Postconditions:* valid() == false.

`std::standard_shared_future`
----------------------------------

```
namespace std {
  template<class T, class E>

      bool valid() const;
  }
  };
}
```

```
standard_shared_future(standard_shared_future&& rhs);
```

*Effects:*
  Move constructs a future object that refers to the shared state that
  was originally referred to by rhs (if any).

*Postconditions:*
 * valid() returns the same value as rhs.valid() prior to the constructor invocation.
 * rhs.valid() == false.


 ```
 standard_shared_future(const standard_shared_future& rhs);
 ```

 *Effects:*
   Copy constructs a future object that refers to the shared state that
   was originally referred to by rhs (if any).

 *Postconditions:*
  * valid() returns the same value as rhs.valid() prior to the constructor invocation.

```
standard_shared_future(standard_continuable_future&& rhs);
```

*Effects:*
  Move constructs a future object that refers to the shared state that
  was originally referred to by rhs (if any).

*Postconditions:*
 * valid() returns the same value as rhs.valid() prior to the constructor invocation.
 * rhs.valid() == false.

```
template<class ReturnFuture, class F>
ReturnFuture then(F&&);
```

*Requires:*
  F satisfies the requirements of FutureContinuation.

*Returns:*
  A `ContinuableFuture` that is bound to the executor `e` and
  that wraps the type returned by execution of either the value or exception
  operations implemented in the continuation. The type of the returned
  `ContinuableFuture` is defined by `Executor` `E`.

*Effects:*
  For `NORMAL` defined as the expression `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<F>(g))(val)` if
  `T` is non-void and `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<F>(g))()` if `T` is void,

  For `EXCEPTIONAL` defined as the expression
  `DECAY_COPY(std::forward<F>(f))(exception_arg, ex)`,

  When `*this` becomes nonexceptionally ready, and if `NORMAL` is a
  well-formed expression, creates an execution agent which invokes `NORMAL`
  at most once, with the call to `DECAY_COPY` being evaluated in the thread
  that called `then_execute`.

  Otherwise, when `*this` becomes exceptionally ready, if `EXCEPTIONAL` is a
  well-formed expression, creates an execution agent which invokes
  `EXCEPTIONAL` at most once, with the call to `DECAY_COPY` being evaluated
  in the thread that called `then_execute`.

  If `NORMAL` and `EXCEPTIONAL` are both well-formed expressions,
  `decltype(EXCEPTIONAL)` shall be convertible to `R`.

  If `NORMAL` is not a well-formed expression and `EXCEPTIONAL` is a
  well-formed expression, `decltype(EXCEPTIONAL)` shall be convertible to
  `decltype(val)`.

  If neither `NORMAL` nor `EXCEPTIONAL` are well-formed expressions, the
  invocation of `then_execute` shall be ill-formed.

  May block pending completion of `NORMAL` or `EXCEPTIONAL`.

  The invocation of `then_execute` synchronizes with
  (C++Std [intro.multithread]) the invocation of `f`.

  Stores the result of either the `NORMAL` or `EXCEPTIONAL` expression, or
  any exception thrown by either, in the associated shared state of the
  resulting `ContinuableFuture`. Otherwise, stores either `val` or `e` in
  the associated shared state of the resulting `ContinuableFuture`.


```
standard_shared_future<T, EI> via(EI ex);
```

*Effects:* Returns a new future that will complete when this completes but
  on which continuations will be enqueued to a new executor.
*Returns:* A standard_shared_future modified to carry executor ex of type EI.
*Requires:*
 * `e` is a `ThenExecutor` where `INVOKE(e, [](T){}, execution::query(e, promise_contract_t<T>).second)` or `INVOKE(e, [](T&){}, execution::query(e, promise_contract_t<T>).second)` is valid.
 * `e` is a `OnewayExecutor` or is convertible to a OnewayExecutor.

```
E get_executor() const;
```

*Returns:* If is_valid() returns true returns the executor contained within the
future. Otherwise throws std::future_error.


```
standard_semi_future<T> semi();
```

*Returns:*
  Returns a standard_semi_future of the same value type as \*this and that
  completes when this completes, but that erases the executor. is_valid() on the
  returned standard_semi_future will return the same value as is_valid() on
  \*this.


```
bool valid() const noexcept;
```

*Returns:* Returns true if this is a valid future. False otherwise.

`std::this_thread::future_wait`
----------------------------------
In [thread.syn] and [thread.thread.this] extend `this_thread` namespace:
```
template<class Future>
  void future_wait(Future& f) noexcept;
```

To [thread.thread.this] add:
```
template<class Future>
  void std::this_thread::future_wait(Future& f) noexcept;
```

*Requires:* SemiFuture<Future>

*Effects:* Blocks the calling thread until `f` becomes ready.

*Synchronization:* The destruction of the continuation that generates `f`'s
  value synchronizes-with the corresponding `future_wait` return.

`std::this_thread::future_get`
----------------------------------
In [thread.syn] and [thread.thread.this] extend `this_thread` namespace:
```
template<class Future>
  auto future_get(Future& f) -> Future::value_type;
```

To [thread.thread.this] add:
```
template<class Future>
  auto std::this_thread::future_get(std::decay_t<Future>&& f)
    -> std::decay_t<Future>::value_type;
```
*Requires:* SemiFuture<Future>

*Effects:* Blocks the calling thread until `f` becomes ready.

*Returns:*
 * If `f` becomes ready with a value, moves the value from `f` and returns it
   to the caller.
 * If `f` becomes ready with an exception, rethrows the exception.

*Synchronization:* The destruction of the continuation that generates `f`'s
 value synchronizes-with the corresponding `future_get` return.

*Throws:* If `f` becomes ready with an exception, that exception is rethrown.

Proposed Changes to Executors
=============================

[p0443](https://wg21.link/P0443) defines a collection of executor types intended
for use managing the execution of tasks on resources.
There are three fundamental executor categories that cover directionality and
control of launch:
 * one-way
 * two-way
 * then

The first two could be considered *immediately launched*. That is that once
handed to the executor,they may start immediately, assuming the internal
executor policies and resources allow it. This makes them very useful for
lazy-launch scenarios.

Lazy launch scenarios are common in callback-based code, and in a wide range of
future library implementations such as
[folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly/tree/master/folly/futures).
In these designs, a callback is executed on completion of some asynchronous
work, and that callback enqueues work into the executor.
This means that work is enqueued only after all dependencies are satisfied.

Then-executors, on the other hand, are intended for explicitly deferred work.
Work can be handed to the executor dependent on prior work, before that prior
work is completed.
This design is fundamentally different, but offers scope for optimisation by
the executor of chains of dependencies that is can batch, without running
additional code on completion of each.

The current executor design is intentionally generic - it makes few requirements
on the future types it can use as input dependencies for the `then_execute` and
`bulk_then_execute` operations.
We can assume that for a future returned by a previous call to `then_execute`
or `bulk_then_execute`, the executor understands the implementation of the
future can can perform whatever depenence tracking and optimisation necessary.
This then is an implementation detail.

However, there will also be interactions where a task to run on one executor is dependent on one produced by another. For this to be practical, we need a standardised mechanism to tie the two executors together.
This amounts to a standard API for triggering deferred work.

Proposed solution
-------------------

To solve this we provide two things:
 * A promise concept, that allows setting of value and/or exception.
 * A mechanism to retrieve from an executor a pair of a promise and a future, such that the future is a valid input dependence for a call to `then_execute` or `bulk_then_execute`.

The promise is a write-only concept. This simplifies the definition and improves flexibility.

The future is not a full future in the sense of future concepts. It is merely a token that completes when the promise is satisfied. This means that it is useful only for connecting to `then_execute` or `bulk_then_execute` on the executor that provided the result.

Proposed New Wording
====================

Wording supplements current text in [p0443](https://wg21.link/P0443).

1.1.x `Promise` requirements
--------------------

A type `P` meets the `Promise` requirements for some value type `T` if an
instance `p` of `P` satisfies the requirements in the table below. `T` may be
void.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Expression</th>
    <th>Return Type</th>
    <th>Operational semantics</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`p.set_value(T)`</td>
    <td>void</td>
    <td>Completes the promise with a value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`p.set_exception(std::exception_ptr)`</td>
    <td>void</td>
    <td>Completes the promise with an exception wrapped in a `std::exception_ptr`.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


1.3.3.2 Promise contract
--------------------

```
template <T>
struct promise_contract_t
{
  static constexpr bool is_requirable = false;
  static constexpr bool is_preferable = false;

  using polymorphic_query_result_type
    = std::pair<std::promise<T>, std::future<T>>;

  template<class Executor>
  static constexpr decltype(auto) static_query_v
    = Executor::query(promise_contract_t());
};
```

The `promise_contract_t` property can be used only with query, which returns the
execution context associated with the executor.

The result of a query of the `promise_contract_t` property applied to a
`ThenExecutor` or `BulkThenExecutor` is a `std::pair` consisting of a `Promise`
and an implementation-defined token type that will be interpreted as a valid
input future by calls to `then_execute` or `bulk_then_execute` and that is
satisfied by calling `set_value` or `set_exception` on the promise.

The value returned from `execution::query(e, promise_contract_t<T>)`, where `e`
is an executor and `T` is a type, should be unique for any given call.
When `e` is a `ThenExecutor` or `BulkThenExecutor` the result of the query is a
`std::pair` where first value is an instance of a type matching the `Promise`
requirements and the second is a token type that `e` will interpret as a valid
future parameter to calls to `then_execute` or `bulk_then_execute`.
When `e` is neither a `ThenExecutor` nor a `BulkThenExecutor` the result of the
query is a `std::pair` where the first value is a `std::promise<T>` and the
second is a `std::future<T>` such that the future was retrieved from the
promise.


1.3.3.2 Cancellable promise contract
--------------------

```
template <T, C>
struct cancellable_promise_contract_t
{
  static constexpr bool is_requirable = false;
  static constexpr bool is_preferable = false;

  using polymorphic_query_result_type
    = std::pair<std::promise<T>, std::future<T>>;

  template<class Executor>
  static constexpr decltype(auto) static_query_v
    = Executor::query(promise_contract_t());

  CancellationCallback cancellation_callback;
};
```

The `cancellable_promise_contract_t` property can be used only with query,
which returns the execution context associated with the executor.
`cancellable_promise_contract_t` differs from `promise_contract_t` in that the
query carries a cancellation callback, `cancellation_callback`, that will be
called as `std::invoke(cancellation_callback)` by the `ThenExecutor` on
cancellation of the task dependent on the future resulting from the
`cancellable_promise_contract_t` query.

The result of a query of the `cancellable_promise_contract_t` property applied
to a `ThenExecutor` or `BulkThenExecutor` is a `std::pair` consisting of a
`Promise` and an implementation-defined token type that will be interpreted as
a valid input future by calls to `then_execute` or `bulk_then_execute`, that
is satisfied by calling `set_value` or `set_exception` on the promise and that
supports cancellation by the executor.

The value returned from
`execution::query(e, cancellable_promise_contract_t<T>{cancellation_callback})`,
where `e` is an executor and `T` is a type, should be unique for any given call.
When `e` is a `ThenExecutor` or `BulkThenExecutor` the result of the query is a
`std::pair` where first value is an instance of a type matching the `Promise`
requirements and the second is a token type that `e` will interpret as a valid
future parameter to calls to `then_execute` or `bulk_then_execute`.
When `e` is neither a `ThenExecutor` nor a `BulkThenExecutor` the result of the
query is a `std::pair` where the first value is a `std::promise<T>` and the
second is a `std::future<T>` such that the future was retrieved from the
promise.
